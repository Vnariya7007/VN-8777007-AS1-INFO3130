                    I wanted him to return me to the way I was before! I was the perfect warrior! Cold and ruthless! I lived by my strength alone,
                    uninhibited by foolish emotion! But slowly...over the years...I became one of you, my quest for greatness
                    gradually giving way
                    to this life of mediocrity. I awoke one day to find that I had settled down, formed a family...I had even
                    grown quite
                    fond of them. Would you believe, I almost started to think the Earth was a nice place to live...? Do you
                    understand now,

                    these petty
                    attachments...and I'd have to say, it feels pretty good."</p>

            <p class="text-3xl leading-loose">Vegeta is arrogant throughout the series and becomes bitter due to the
                abuse his race suffered at the hands of Frieza.Following the destruction of his homeworld Planet
              Vegeta,
              his hatred toward Frieza grows. <span style="color: #497208;">His royalty seems to have bestowed upon him an inflated
                  sense of superiority, holding himself above nearly everyone he encounters.</p>
